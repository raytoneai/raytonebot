/**
 * Admission layer: our protocol and our components are the contract.
 *
 * A backend does not get to render however it likes. Everything entering the transcript is
 * first resolved to a concept this UI actually has a component for; anything that resolves to
 * nothing is routed to the diagnostics channel instead of leaking through as an un-designed
 * generic row. Two real integrations failed exactly that way — harness bookkeeping, plan/todo
 * updates and raw args JSON rendered as conversation rows that looked nothing like the
 * composed design.
 *
 * The layer does three things, all in our terms rather than a given backend's:
 *
 * 1. Resolves tool names to our canonical concepts through an alias table we own. A harness
 *    calling its writer `write`, `create_file` or `str_replace_editor` all land on the same
 *    concept, so the same component renders.
 * 2. Derives the events a backend usually does not emit. Almost no harness has a first-class
 *    "artifact" event — it writes a file with a tool. Without derivation the artifact panel is
 *    empty for every real backend, which is what a PPT-generating run hit.
 * 3. Normalizes titles. An adapter that dumps args JSON into `title` produces rows like
 *    `write {"file_path":"…","content":"<!DOCTYPE html>…"}`; the title is rebuilt from args.
 *
 * Whatever it cannot place is reported, never rendered.
